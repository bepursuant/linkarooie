# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Introduction

As the creator and maintainer of this project, I am committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone. I value the participation of each contributor and want to ensure that all participants have a positive and enriching experience. This Code of Conduct outlines my expectations for behavior and establishes guidelines for maintaining a welcoming and harassment-free environment.

## My Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, I pledge to make participation in this project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards of Behavior

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibility

As the project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor whose behavior is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by me as the project maintainer.

## Reporting Issues

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting me directly at [dean+linkarooie@deanlofts.xyz](mailto:dean+linkarooie@deanlofts.xyz). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

I am committed to maintaining confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be determined on a case-by-case basis.

## Enforcement

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a contributor engages in unacceptable behavior, I may take any action deemed appropriate, including a temporary or permanent ban from the project without warning.
