# Linkarooie

[![Build Status](https://github.com/loftwah/linkarooie/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/loftwah/linkarooie/actions)

Linkarooie is a simple and open-source alternative to Linktree, allowing you to manage and share all your important links in one place. This project was created as a replacement for BioDrop (LinkFree) after it was archived. It is built using Ruby on Rails and is designed to be easy to deploy and customize.

## Features

- **Custom Links:** Easily add and manage your links.
- **Analytics:** Track the performance of your links.
- **Social Integration:** Seamlessly connect all your social media profiles.
- **Responsive Design:** Works well on any device.
- **User Achievements:** Showcase your accomplishments.
- **Pinned Links:** Highlight your most important links.
- **User Profiles:** Customizable profiles with avatars, banners, and descriptions.
- **Open Graph Image Generation:** Automatically generate social media preview images.

## Demo

Check out a live demo at [linkarooie.com](https://linkarooie.com).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.1.3 or higher
- SQLite3
- Node.js and npm (for asset compilation)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Git

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/loftwah/linkarooie.git
   cd linkarooie
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:

   ```bash
   rails db:create db:migrate
   ```

4. Start the Rails server:

   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

#### Analytics Temporary

I have added analytics but not a dashboard to view them yet. This is how it works so far.

- Open the Rails console `rails console`

```ruby
puts "Page Views for loftwah:"
user = User.find_by(username: 'loftwah')
puts user.page_views.count

puts "\nMost recent Page Views with new data:"
puts PageView.order(created_at: :desc).limit(5).map { |pv| "#{pv.path} - #{pv.created_at} - IP: #{pv.ip_address} - Session: #{pv.session_id}" }

puts "\nLink Clicks for loftwah's links:"
puts user.links.sum { |link| link.link_clicks.count }

puts "\nMost recent Link Clicks with new data:"
puts LinkClick.order(created_at: :desc).limit(5).map { |lc| "#{lc.link.title} - #{lc.created_at} - IP: #{lc.ip_address} - Session: #{lc.session_id}" }

puts "\nMost viewed pages:"
puts PageView.group(:path).order('count_id DESC').limit(5).count(:id)

puts "\nMost clicked links:"
puts LinkClick.joins(:link).group('links.title').order('count_id DESC').limit(5).count(:id)

puts "\nTotal tracking counts:"
puts "Page Views: #{PageView.count}"
puts "Link Clicks: #{LinkClick.count}"
puts "Achievement Views: #{AchievementView.count}"

puts "\nUnique IP addresses:"
puts "Page Views: #{PageView.distinct.count(:ip_address)}"
puts "Link Clicks: #{LinkClick.distinct.count(:ip_address)}"
puts "Achievement Views: #{AchievementView.distinct.count(:ip_address)}"

puts "\nUnique sessions:"
puts "Page Views: #{PageView.distinct.count(:session_id)}"
puts "Link Clicks: #{LinkClick.distinct.count(:session_id)}"
puts "Achievement Views: #{AchievementView.distinct.count(:session_id)}"
```

### Docker Deployment

1. Build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost` in your browser.

Note: The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build process to create a lean production image. It installs necessary dependencies, precompiles assets, and sets up the application to run as a non-root user for improved security.

### DigitalOcean Deployment

1. Set up a DigitalOcean account and generate an API token.

2. Create a DigitalOcean Droplet with Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply -var="do_token=YOUR_DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN"
   ```

3. Deploy the app using GitHub Actions:

   * Ensure you have the following secrets set in your GitHub repository:
     * `DROPLET_IP`: The IP address of your DigitalOcean Droplet (output from Terraform).
     * `DROPLET_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`: The private SSH key to access your Droplet.
     * `GH_PAT`: Your GitHub Personal Access Token.

   * Push your code to the `main` branch, and the GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the latest version to your Droplet.

4. Important Note on Docker Installation:
   The user data script in the Terraform configuration installs Docker using the get.docker.com script. However, this installation is not instantaneous and may take a few minutes to complete after the Droplet is created.

5. Checking Docker Installation Status:
   If you encounter issues with Docker not being available immediately after Droplet creation, you can check the cloud-init logs:

   ```bash
   ssh root@YOUR_DROPLET_IP
   sudo tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
   ```

   This will show you the progress of the initialization script, including the Docker installation.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `RAILS_ENV`: Set to `production` for production environments.
- `SECRET_KEY_BASE`: Rails secret key for production.
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string (if using a different database in production).

### Database

The project uses SQLite by default. For production, consider using PostgreSQL or MySQL.

### Geolocation

For now this isn't optional but I intend to make it to. [API key required](https://ipapi.com) but it is free.

## Customization

Linkarooie is highly customizable:

* **Views:** Modify the HTML/CSS in the `app/views` directory.
* **Styles:** Customize the look and feel using Tailwind CSS.
* **Features:** Add or modify features in the `app/controllers` and `app/models` directories.

## Testing

Run the test suite with:

```bash
rspec
```
