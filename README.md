## Overview

Linkarooie is your go-to, Ruby on Rails-powered web dashboard, perfect for setting as your browser's homepage. Why settle for a standard, uninspiring start page when you can customize your own digital launchpad? From managing vital links to personalizing aesthetics, Linkarooie not only simplifies your web experience but also serves as an invaluable learning platform for Ruby on Rails enthusiasts.

### Get Started with Linkarooie: Your Personalized Web Jump-Off Point

Whether you're a casual browser or a full-stack developer, Linkarooie offers you a richer, more interactive starting point for your web ventures. Hop on board and hop your way through the web!

### What is it though?

Imagine your computer's web browser is like a magic carpet that can take you to all sorts of places on the internet. But every time you get on that carpet, it starts at a very plain and boring spot, like an empty room.

Linkarooie changes that. It's like decorating that empty room with all your favorite things. You can add shortcuts to your favorite websites, like a treasure chest that holds maps to your favorite places. You can even change how the room looks by picking your favorite colors or putting up a cool picture.

So, every time you start your magic carpet (web browser), you'll see this awesome room (Linkarooie dashboard) first. It makes going on internet adventures way more fun and easy!

And the coolest part? Linkarooie is like a toy you can build and change yourself because it's made with something called Ruby on Rails, which is a set of building blocks for making websites. So, you can learn how to add more cool stuff to your room while you use it!
